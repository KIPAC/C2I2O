- Includes: [linting, testing, coverage]
- Uses: [specific actions or tools]



I've completed [TASK]. Please:
1. Update the project context
2. Suggest what to work on next
3. Identify any new dependencies or considerations




Before implementing [FEATURE], let's:
1. Review the current architecture
2. Discuss the approach
3. Identify affected files
4. Then generate the code
