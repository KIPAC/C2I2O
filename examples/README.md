# c2i2o Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use c2i2o for cosmological inference and emulation.

## Examples Overview


## Running Examples

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Make sure c2i2o is installed
pip install -e .

# Run an example
python examples/01_basic_parameters.py


## Requirements

    c2i2o with core dependencies (numpy, scipy, pydantic)
    matplotlib (for visualization in some examples)

## Install visualization dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```


## Example Data

Some examples generate synthetic data. Real cosmological data would typically come from:

    Surveys (DES, LSST, Euclid)
    Simulations
    Theory calculations (using CCL, CAMB, CLASS)
